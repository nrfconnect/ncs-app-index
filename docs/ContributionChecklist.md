# Add-on contributor checklist

---

You must meet the following criteria if you want to contribute with a new add-on:

- [ ] Register a new account on [Nordic Semiconductor DevZone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/) using your company's e-mail provided as contact in our mailing list.

- [ ] Create a Pull Request to the [nRF Connect SDK Add-on repository](https://github.com/nrfconnect/ncs-app-index). This Pull Request should add the new file that describes your organization and the add-ons you are adding. It should also include the proof of reliability of the new add-ons, for example a brief description of tests executed. More details can be found in [Contributing](https://github.com/nrfconnect/ncs-app-index/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [ ] Make sure the CI/CD passes for the Pull Request to be approved and merged.
