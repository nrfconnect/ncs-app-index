### Contribution Guidelines

If you or your organization has a project that you'd like to include in the nRF Connect SDK App Index, you can do so by opening a pull request against this repository.

Inside your pull request, create a JSON file named after your GitHub account in the `index` directory (e.g. `index/nrfconnect.json`). Include information about your account or organization, then add an entry for each app you want to be shown in the index to the `apps` array. The `name` field of each app must match a GitHub repository in your account.

If you use Visual Studio Code, the editor will automatically provide validation and autocompletion for the index file. If you are using another editor, you can use the JSON schema located at `resources/schema.json` to validate your file. Make sure that your file correctly follows the schema before creating your pull request, otherwise the CI pipeline will fail.

Make sure that your pull request only adds a new JSON file to the `index` directory, or amends your existing file. Pull requests that make other changes to the repository will be rejected.

Once your pull request is approved and merged, the app index will be rebuilt and republished automatically.
